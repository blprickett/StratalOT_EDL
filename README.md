# StratalOT_EDL
A Stratal OT Model (Kiparsky 2000), that finds pairwise ranking probabilities using Expectation Driven Learning (Jarosz 2015). The software is in the form of a .ipynb file (meant to be used with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb)) and example input files are also included (which are meant to be uploayded to [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/), prior to running the script in Colab).
